		<h2>What is Mousse?</h2>
			<div style="max-width:700px; word-wrap:break-word;">
		This easy chocolate mousse recipe is one of my favorite chocolate desserts as it’s light as air. Mousse has a fluffy texture created by folding heat-treated whipped egg whites into a mixture of melted chocolate, coffee, and egg yolks. The egg yolks give richness and depth that take a bar of chocolate and transform it into something fluffy and luxurious.<br>

		<h2>Are There Raw Eggs in Mousse?</h2>
		<div style="max-width:1000px; word-wrap:break-word;">
		<p>If you’re worried about eating raw eggs, fear not! The yolks in the mousse are gently cooked by the hot melted chocolate in a bain marie. I make a bain marie by boiling a bit of water in my GoodCook Classic 2 Quart Sauce Pan, then setting a bowl inside which I use to gently melt my chocolate. This allows steam to gently melt the chocolate and helps the texture stay extra velvety. As for the whipped egg whites, no need to worry — they are not raw.<br><br>

		I heat treat the whipped egg whites by quickly whipping them in my GoodCook Gourmet 3 Quart Mixing Bowl over the same bain marie I melted the chocolate over. You don’t need to do this for long as you don’t want to deflate the foamy egg white – they make your mousse airy! You just want to ensure they are not raw after roughly 2-3 minutes. After this, I take two turns to simply whisk this mixture into the melted chocolate with my GoodCook Stainless Steel Whisk.<br><br>

		After the egg whites are completely and gently folded in, I transfer the mousse to my individual serving dishes. The mousse will set up nicely in the fridge before being garnished. I like to garnish mine with a bit of whipped cream and shaved chocolate.<br><br>

		I’m sometimes asked if you can freeze your mousse and the simple answer is no. You can, however, refrigerate the mousse for up to three days. You might also ask if you can substitute eggs. You can completely omit eggs with my vegan chocolate mousse recipe. This great alternative uses aquafaba, the water strained off from a can of chickpeas, in substitution of egg whites.<br><br>

		<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1¼ cups bittersweet chocolate (7 1⁄2 oz/213g)</li>
			<li>½ cup water (4 fl oz/115 ml)</li>
			<li>3 large eggs , separated</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
			<li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon instant coffee granules</li>
			<li>Whipped cream to decorate</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Instructions:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Place the chocolate, coffee, and water in a Good Cook Gourmet 3 Quart Mixing Bowl heatproof bowl and set over a Good Cook Classic 2 Quart Sauce Pan of just simmering water. Don’t let the bottom of the bowl touch the water. Heat gently until the chocolate is melted.</li>
			<li>Remove from the heat and leave to cool slightly. Then swiftly stir in the egg yolks, vanilla and salt with a whisk until well combined. Take care not to ‘over mix’ as the fat in the chocolate will separate and your mix will appear oily.</li>
			<li>In a large bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form. You can do this by hand using a Good Cook Stainless Steel Whisk. Gently fold into the chocolate mixture in 2 batches. The fast you do this process the better as the chocolate starts to set.</li>
			<li>Spoon the mousse into individual dishes and chill for at least 6 hours or overnight. Top with softly whipped cream and chocolate shavings.</li>
		</ol>
