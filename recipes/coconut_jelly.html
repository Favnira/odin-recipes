		<h2>What is Coconut Jelly?</h2>
			<div style="max-width:700px; word-wrap:break-word;">
		Topped with delicious fruit — I chose tropical — my Coconut Jelly recipe (also known as Melo Melo) is the silkiest dessert you'll ever have!<br>

		<h2>Hanna’s Pro Chef Tips for Making Fresh Coconut Jelly</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>This recipe will become just lightly set, and it won’t unmold easily, so it’s best to stick to individual servings instead of one large one.</li>
			<li>When heating the gelatin in the coconut water mixture, take care to heat gently and not let the mixture boil, or the gelatin may not set properly.</li>
			<li>The straining step is important to ensure properly dissolved sugar and gelatin. If there are any solids left in the strainer, you can return everything to the pot and continue to heat until all is dissolved.</li>
			<li>I love topping this jelly with mango and kiwi, but you can use papaya, bananas, or other soft, tropical fruit.</li>
			<li>Try a drizzle of chocolate sauce in place of or in addition to the fresh fruit!</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>¼ cup (2floz/60ml) whole milk</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon unflavored gelatin powder</li>
			<li>2 cups (16floz/480ml) fresh coconut water</li>
			<li>1 cup (8floz/240ml) full fat coconut milk</li>
			<li>⅓ cup (2½oz/71g) granulated sugar</li>
			<li>2 cups (10oz/284g) diced mango (or fruit of your choice)</li>
			<li>2 kiwis (diced)</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Instructions:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Place 6 (8-oz) cups or bowls on a small tray and set aside.</li>
			<li>Add the milk to a small bowl and sprinkle evenly with the gelatin. Set aside for 5-10 minutes to let bloom.</li>
			<li>In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, combine the coconut water, coconut milk, and sugar and heat until the sugar is dissolved.</li>
			<li>Add the bloomed gelatin and stir until fully melted, making sure the mixture is warm but not simmering.</li>
			<li>Once dissolved, pour through a strainer into a glass measuring cup with a pour spout.</li>
			<li>Divide the mixture evenly among the cups on the tray and refrigerate until set, about 4-6 hours.</li>
			<li>Just before serving, top with diced fresh fruit. Cover leftovers and keep refrigerated for up to 3 days.</li>
		</ol>
